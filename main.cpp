/*********************************************************************
 ** Description: This program runs the Conway's Game of Life at least
 **              one time, animating the world's evolution in the
 **              console.  The user has the choice of determining which
 **              initial cells will be alive (by choosing a predefined
 **              pattern and offset), how many generations to display,
 **              and how long each generation is displayed on the
 **              screen.
